//Given a list of options (nums) where each value is unique
//and each value can be used as many times as you would like return
//the number of permutations that can add up to the target value.

//To solve this I used DP and memoization. The first thing
//to understand is since the nums list will not change as you 
//recurse you can use a simple memoization technique because you 
//do not have changing constraints depending on which numbers
//have been used in the past. Given this each time you run into
//a target value you can check how many ways that target can become 0
//if the problem has been done before return the answer if not recurse to find
//all possible ways to reach 0 from that position with the options in the nums list.
//Then return the possible ways to do it to the parent. Continue doing this until all 
//nums have been iterated through and return the final number of satisfying permutations.
