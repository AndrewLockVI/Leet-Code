//Given a list of words return the k most frequently used
//words in the list. If there are multiple words used the same
//number of times return them in lexographical order.
//To do this I first created a map that stored how many times
//a given word was used. Then from there I created a sorted list
//that stored the number of times each word was used and sorted it.
//I then created a list for each number of occurences meaning 
//if a word occurs twice then there should be two lists one for 
//words that happen one time and one for words that happen twice.
//Then I iterated through these lists to find the most common elements.
