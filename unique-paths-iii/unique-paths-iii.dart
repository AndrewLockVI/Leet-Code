//Given a grid return all possible traversals of the grid such that you never
//go to spots with obstacles (-1) and you never miss a single square. Also, you start
//from 1 and end at 2 which can be any position on the board.

//I solved this using backtracking as there is not a good way to memoize this problem. Starting out
//I first found where the starting point was located which is the spot that equals 1. From there I called 
//my function that checks all paths to find all paths to the endpoint (2) that visits every square. This
//function works using DFS where each iteration creates a new grid with the last position visited marked
//as -1 so that you never go back and you can always know if you have visited all points. From here you keep moving
//until you either reach out of bounds, an obstacle (or a prevously visited spot), or the end point. If you reach the end
//point it then checks the entire matrix to see if there are any spots that have been unvisited that should have been visited
//if there are not then add 1 to the answer.
