//Given a value n where n is the amount of soup of type a and b
//return the probability that a will run out first plus half the probability
//that a and b run out at the same time.

//To solve this I used DP, memoization, and recursion.
//I recursively called the soupServe function with each possible
//service option. Once you reach the bottom it will then return
//.5 if a and b = 0 or 1 if only b = 0. Using this we then
//add the probabilities of each option together and divide by the options
//to get the probabilities. From here we memoize the solution so we do not
//need to solve again from the starting point of a = a given number and b = a given number.

//Note: If the value is greater than 4800 then the probability
//of b reaching 0 first is so close to 1 that a double can not be accurate at that
//point so instead of running into a stack overflow issue it is best to return 1
//even though theoretically it could compute without it presuming the stack depth of your
//system is astronomically high.
